      Data stream ID number, 16-bit integer, assigned by user, 1â€“65534 (0 and 65535 are reserved). 
      Identifies destination data stream for commands and source data stream for other messages. A 
      stream will be hosted by a device that can be physical or virtual. If a device only hosts one 
      data stream, the IDCODE identifies the device as well as the stream. If the device hosts more 
      than one data stream, there shall be a different IDCODE for each stream.

      Time stamp, 32-bit unsigned number, SOC count starting at midnight 01-Jan-1970 (UNIX time base).
      Range is 136 years, rolls over 2106 AD.
      Leap seconds are not included in count, so each year has the same number of seconds except leap 
      years, which have an extra day (86 400 s).
