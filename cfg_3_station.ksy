      This 128-bit Global PMU ID shall be a user-assigned value. It shall 
      be stored in the PMU or other sending device so it can be sent with 
      this configuration 3 message. It allows uniquely identifying PMUs in 
      a system that has more than 65535 PMUs. The coding for the 16 bytes 
      is left to the user for assignment.

      Number of digital status words.
      Digital status words are normally 16-bit Boolean numbers with each 
      bit representing a digital status channel measured by a PMU. A 
      digital status word may be used in other user-designated ways.

      Phasor and channel names―in ASCII with field index (see Table 12). 
      Minimum of 1 byte for each phasor, analog, and digital channel. 
      Names are in the same order as they are transmitted: all phasors, 
      all analogs, and all digitals. For digital channels, the channel 
      name order will be from the least significant to the most 
      significant. (The first name is for bit 0 of the first 16-bit status 
      word, the second is for bit 1, etc., up to bit 15. If there is more 
      than 1 digital status, the next name will apply to bit 0 of the 
      second word and so on.)
