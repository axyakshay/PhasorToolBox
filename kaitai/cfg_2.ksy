      If DATA_RATE > 0, rate is number of frames per second.
      If DATA_RATE < 0, rate is negative of seconds per frame.
      E.g., DATA_RATE = 15 is 15 frames per second; DATA_RATE = –5 is 1

          9 (and higher if more than one PMU data is present) identify the 
          original source of the data and will usually be associated with a 
          particular PMU. The IDCODEs in a data stream received directly 
          from a PMU will usually be the same.

          Number of digital status words.
          Digital status words are normally 16-bit Boolean numbers with each 
          bit representing a digital status channel measured by a PMU. A 
          digital status word may be used in other user-designated ways.

          in the same order as they are transmitted. For digital channels, 
          the channel name order will be from the least significant to the 
          most significant. (The first name is for bit 0 of the first 16-bit 
          status word, the second is for bit 1, etc., up to bit 15. If there 
          is more than 1 digital status, the next name will apply to bit 0 
          of the second word and so on.)
